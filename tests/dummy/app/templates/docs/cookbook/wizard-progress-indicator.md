# Wizard with Progress Indicator

What if you want to provide the user with a progress indicator that allows them to represent where they are in the wizard? Since the `step-manager` yields all of the step names as an `Array`, you can dynamically create a progress indicator. You can even allow the user to navigate to a specific step by clicking on the location in the indicator.

# Basic Wizard

`ember-steps` can be used to create a "wizard" interface that walks users through a series of steps one at a time. In the basic example below, we simply allow the user to advance "forward" and "backward" through the set of steps.

Note that we can prevent the user from "wrapping around" to the first step by disabling the progress button once they get to the last step.

## Installation

```bash
ember install ember-steps
```

## Basic Usage

Using `ember-steps` starts with creating a `step-manager`.

```handlebars
<StepManager as |w|>
  We'll put some cool stuff in here in a moment
</StepManager>
```

Cool, right?  Ehh, it doesn't do much yet -- we need to add some steps.

```handlebars
<StepManager as |w|>
  <w.step @name="a">
    This is the first step!
  </w.step>

  <w.step @name="b">
    This is the second step!
  </w.step>
</StepManager>
```

As you may have guessed, the first `w.step` component, `a`, will be visible initially, and `b` will be invisible.  Note that these names are important.  Why?  Because we need a way to transition between them!

```handlebars
<StepManager as |w|>
  <w.step @name="a">
    This is the first step!

    <button {{action w.transition-to 'b'}}>
      Next, please!
    </button>
  </w.step>

  <w.step @name="b">
    This is the second step!

    <button {{action w.transition-to 'a'}}>
      Wait, go back!
    </button>
  </w.step>
</StepManager>
```

The `step-manager` provides a [closure action][ember-closure-actions] that can be called with the name of a step to show that one, instead.  One of the neat features of `ember-steps` is that there is no explicit order to the steps; show all of them, or only some. It's entirely up to you.

## Not-So-Basic Usage

The above examples show the basic idea, but there's more configuration (and power) available if you need it.  Head over to {{docs-link 'the cookbook' 'docs.cookbook'}} to read more about what `ember-steps` can do!

## Compatibility Note

Ember `2.12` is the earliest version that the tests are run against. YMMV with older versions of Ember.
